# Web-scraping and lineal regression
## Roberto Linares

For this project, we will aim to determine international success of films (if possible, a targeted prediction based on specific regions of the world), by analyzing domestic (USA) and worldwide lifetime gross, genre, actors, director, writer, franchise or domestic distributor, budget, running time and MPPA, of approximately 1000 films. 

By developing this model, we will be able to provide the buyers of distributions rights (of motion pictures), the safest bets for the acquisition of films with a higher estimated lifetime gross. 

The main source of data to achieve this project's goal will be the website [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com).
